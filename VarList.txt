In a waveform, stats can be collected such as:
    starttime and endtime

    sampling_rate:

    Description: The number of samples per second in the waveform (sampling frequency).
    Type: float
    Example: 100.0 (100 samples per second)

npts:

    Description: The number of data points (samples) in the Trace.
    Type: int
    Example: 6000 (for a 60-second trace with a sampling rate of 100 Hz)

network:

    Description: The seismic network code.
    Type: str
    Example: "AM" (for the Raspberry Shake network)

station:

    Description: The station code where the data was recorded.
    Type: str
    Example: "R1382"

location:

    Description: The location code (used if there are multiple instruments at one station).
    Type: str
    Example: "00"

channel:

    Description: The channel code (typically describes the type of instrument and component, e.g., EHZ for a vertical component of a seismometer).
    Type: str
    Example: "EHZ"

calib:

    Description: The calibration factor used to convert data to physical units.
    Type: float
    Example: 1.0 (no scaling applied)

mseed:

    Description: Contains additional MiniSEED metadata such as encoding, byte order, and data quality flags.
    Type: AttribDict
    Example: {'dataquality': 'D', 'number_of_records': 36, 'encoding': 'STEIM2', ...}

delta:

    Description: The time interval between two samples (inverse of sampling rate).
    Type: float
    Example: 0.01 (if the sampling rate is 100 Hz, delta is 1/100 = 0.01 seconds)

_format:

    Description: The format of the waveform file (e.g., MiniSEED, SAC, etc.).
    Type: str
    Example: "MSEED"

processing:

    Description: A list of the processing steps applied to the data.
    Type: list
    Example: ['remove_response()', 'detrend()']

sac (if SAC format is used):

    Description: SAC header information if the data is from a SAC file. This includes metadata like event location, origin time, station coordinates, etc.
    Type: AttribDict
    Example: { 'evla': 10.0, 'evlo': 12.0, 'evdp': 5.0, ... }

Other variables obspy can find are:
Variables that can be measured:
1. Peak Ground Acceleration, Velocity, Displacement
2. Fourier Spectra
3. Response Spectrum
4. Seismic Moment
5. Magnitude (Local and Moment)
6. Seismic Spectral Analysis (H/V Ratio)
7.
